# **Dyvenia training period summary**

## **Markdown**

As a markdown training I used below markdown [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), that helped me learned MKD fundamentals in a
practical way.

I also found a [cheat sheet](https://www.collectiveray.com/markdown-cheat-sheet) with a most common and useful features that helped me lot in this file preparation.

## **Mermaid Gannt charts**

Below I prepared some sample of the skills I gained through gant mermaid [documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/gantt) learning which gave me preety basic skills which I will be able to use in future projects planning.

## **Scrum training**

### _Task = Find training to be part of Scrum team_

As a task completion I did a [Introduction to Scrum Master Training](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-certified-scrum-master) course. I think now I have a preety solid 
understandng of Agile approach and Scrums metodology. 

## **STAR way of communicating**

![](https://www.thecvwriter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/star-interview-technique.png)

### **Main thought:**

Focus on the core of the problem/situation/hypothesis You’re trying to present. **Follow the below steps:**

<li> At first prepare to be able to provide solid and simple background for the situation that would be understandable for audience,
<li> make and present the list of tasks that You need to cover throughout the process, 
<li>try to specify the list of tasks by describing concrete action that You’re planning to take, 
<li>and at the end provide results-focus on changes and benefits that Your actions will make.


## **Storytelling in Data Analytics / Data Science**

### **Main thought:**

**Good habits:** 

- Present data in a way that will be interesting for your stakeholders. 

- Try asking the proper questions that will lead to the proper conclusions;
    - think about it like not only presenting your thoughts from the analysing part but try to find a way to describe how these thoughts can impact the business so f.e. Increase revenue, reduce costs etc. 

- Prepare some dashboards that will allow you to filter specific data and spotlight them. 


**Bad habits:** 

* Being too direct with Your story/thoughts/conclusions. You should focus on present data in a way that your audience will be able to draw proper conclusions by themselves.

* Using incorrect chart types to the data that you want to present f.e pie chart to show changes through the year.

## Existing documentation for AIA team, review existing Python + SQL flows + SQL excercise
So I get familiar with existing Azure DevOps wiki files and python and SQL flows, which I have to admit was the hardest part of the training, mainly bc it's so easier
to me to learning things by doing them, than studing existing code but I'm aware that's a important part of the proces so I tried my best to understand it as much as I could.

I also prepared a simple visualization which was a part of the last excercise.
